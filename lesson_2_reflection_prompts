What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	a .git directory is created inside the repository. The new repository 
	doesn't contains any commits. A repository its a place where the history 
	of your work is stored, without a repository you can't use any version-
	control features. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is part of git. It's an intermediate area between the 
	working directory and the git repository. 
	You can add files one at a time to the staging area. Then, when you’re ready
	to commit, git bundles the entire contents of the staging area into a single 
	commit and adds that to the repository.
	Staging area offers flexibility. You don't have to commit all your files in 
	the repository but only the ones you choose. For example you don't have to 
	commit all your files in case you have made some changes to only one file. 
	Remember that you should make one commit per logical change, so commiting 
	only the file you've changed is useful.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	Staging area offers flexibility because you can add files one at a time.
	Therefore, you are able to commit whatever you choose. You should commit
	only the file you've changed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branching is a useful way to experiment with new features and not have to 
	worry about breaking what you currently have. By branching you create a copy
	of the current state of the master branch. You are free to make any changes 
	to the new branch but these changes do not affect the master branch. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
