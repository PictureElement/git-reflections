When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  	 With a remote repository you can share your local repository with other 
     people and collaborate. Other people can contribute to your project.
     Since remote repositories are cloud based, they're accessible by anyone 
     with Internet access. Also they provide a form of backup. 
      
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  	 Because in that way you have more control over your code. If a new version
  	 of the code is availbale on GitHub but happens to be buggy, I might not 
  	 want to pull any changes until the bug is fixed.
